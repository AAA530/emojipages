  Thank you for opening this pull request, your code will be reviewed soon! 
    
    
  Important Notes:
  
  
  There is a limit to the number of pull requests you can make on this project due to the large amount of activity. Please limit yourself to adding 4 shows/movies or completing 4 Issues. Some Issues ask that you add mulitple shows/movies, that will count as 1 addition. The limit will be removed in the future but for now I want to allow as many people as possible to have the chance contribute. 
  
  
  
  If any updates need to be made, I will leave a comment for you here outlining exactly what you need to change for your pull request to be accepted. ðŸ’œ
