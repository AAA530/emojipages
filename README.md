## Choosing a Book or Play to Add

Here are some links to lists of books and plays in case you're having trouble thinking of something to add! 

#### I have also [added Issues for individual books and plays](https://github.com/brittanyrw/emojipages/labels/add%20book) that I think would be fun to add to EmojiPages. Feel free to add any of the books listed in Issues. Make sure to comment inside of the Issue if you plan on taking it and add the Issue number in your Pull Request.

## Card Overview

On the website, each `Emoji Card` displays 1) images of the emojis, 2) a hint icon that will show the type (musical, movie or TV show) when the user hovers and 3) the name of the show (which appears when the user clicks on a card).

![Screenshot of Beauty and the Beast Emoji Card](readme/emoji-card.png)

In the `data.js` file, each `Emoji Card` consists of the following object:

```
{
    title: "The Devil Wears Prada",
    author: ["Lauren Weisberger"],
    emojiImgs: "üòàüë©üèª‚Äçü¶≥üë†üë©üèªüëóüëõ",
    genres: ["drama", "comedy","romance"],
    year: 2003
}
```

To add a new card to the website, add a new object in the `data.js` file. Make sure to separate your new object from existing objects with a comma. Below is an overview of each key in the `Emoji Card` object. Every key is required.

### Title üëç

Each card must have a title. This should be the full title.

```
{
  title: "Beauty and the Beast",
}
```

### Emojis üòç

The emojis should be added to `emojiImgs` as a string. Your emojis should be surrounded by double quotation marks.

## **Important Note: Add five emojis maximum for each card**

```
{
  emojiImgs: "üè∞ü•Äüé∂üìöüï∞Ô∏è",
}
```

Using JavaScript, the emojis are converted into [Twemoji (Twitter's emoji version)](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) so that all emojis will be uniform across platforms. And because they are pretty cute. üíñ

Here are a few resources to find emojis to copy:

- [Twitter Emojis](https://www.piliapp.com/twitter-symbols/) - Shows you what each Twitter emoji looks like. 
- [Get Emoji](https://getemoji.com/) and [EmojiCopy](https://www.emojicopy.com/) are tools to copy regular emojis easily from one page. Note: The initial homepage does not display all skin color versions of each emoji so you will need to search in Emojipedia for those.
- [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) - A directory of all emojis.

Note when you copy these emojis and paste them into your text editor or Github, they will no longer look like the Twitter emojis. But don't worry, Javascript will convert them to the Twitter emojis on the EmojiScreen website.

### Genres üîç

The genres should be added as an array (the square [] brackets indicates an array or list). Separate each genre with a comma and each genre should be wrapped in quotes. There is no limit to the number of genres but try not to add too many.

```
{
  genres: ["animation", "family", "fantasy"],
}
```

For movies and TV shows, go to the IMDB profile and find the genres listed under the title. Add these genres to the `Emoji Card` object. Some cards will only have one genre, that is okay! Use the genre chart below as a guide for which genres are available.

See the below screenshot for the location of the genre listing in IMDB profiles.

![Screenshot of the Beauty and the Beast IDMB profile with the genres circled](readme/imdb-screenshot.png)


For musicals, include the `musical` genre and any other genres from the list below that you think fit:

|         |           |           |           |        |         |             |       |
| ------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ------ | ------- | ----------- | ----- |
| action  | adventure | animation | biography | comedy | crime   | documentary | drama |
| family  | fantasy   | film-noir | history   | horror | music   | mystery     | news  |
| romance | sci-fi    | sport     | thriller  | war    | western |             |       |
|         |           |           |           |        |         |             |       |

### Link üîó

Add a link to the [IMDB page](https://www.imdb.com/) if TV show or movie, or [Playbill archive page](http://www.playbill.com/vault) if it is a musical.

Make sure the link includes `https` or `http` at the beginning. The link must be wrapped in quotation marks.

For TV shows and movies, add the [IMDB page](https://www.imdb.com/) link.

For musicals link the [Playbill archive page](http://www.playbill.com/vault) for the show. Make sure the Playbill link is for the original production. It will say 'original' under the show name on Playbill. Here is an example of [the page you should be linking](http://www.playbill.com/production/les-miserables-broadway-theatre-vault-0000012257) for musicals.

```
{
  itemLink: "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101414/",
}
```


### Type üé¨

Specify if the card you are adding is `tv`, `movie` or `musical`. Only add one type per card. 

`musical` under type is referring to live musicals performed on Broadway, the West End, local theaters etc. If you are adding a **movie** musical, please choose `movie` as the type and indicate it is a musical via genres.

```
{
  type: "movie",
}
```

### Year üìÜ

Specify the year the movie or show was released or first aired. Or the first performance year for a musical. This should be a  single number (no quotations around the year). Do not add ranges such as 2017-2019. 

```
{
  year: 1994
}
```

## Walkthrough

Follow these instructions to add a card. You can add a card using the Github website user interface or on your local machine. If you do not already have one, create a Github account before proceeding.

> If you are already comfortable using Github and Git, feel free to skip the instructions below and make a pull request using whatever method you prefer!

## Github UI

### This method will use the Github website to contribute to this project. You will not need to download any programs to your computer using these instructions.

1. Check the Issues to see if the [movie](https://github.com/brittanyrw/emojiscreen/labels/movie), [series of movies](https://github.com/brittanyrw/emojiscreen/labels/add%20series), [TV show](https://github.com/brittanyrw/emojiscreen/labels/tv), [or musical](https://github.com/brittanyrw/emojiscreen/labels/musical) is listed.
- If it is not listed as an issue, continue to the next step.
- If it is listed as an Issue, take note of the Issue number (the number next to the title of the Issue) so that you can add it to your pull request and write a comment in the Issue stating that you will be adding that particular movie or show. If there is already a comment in the Issue from someone saying that they will add that show or movie, choose something else to add. 
2. Fork this repository. This will create a copy of the repository and create a new repository on your account. Note: the `Fork` button is located in the top right area of the repo.
3. Once the repo is forked, you will be taken to the forked repo. Note: In the top left, the name of the repo should now include your username.
4. Navigate to the `data.js` file in your forked repo by clicking on the file name.
5. Edit the `data.js` file by clicking on the pencil icon and add a new object for your book or play in alphabetical order.  **Note: If the title starts with 'The' then use the next word for alphabetical order.** Make sure there is a comma between your object and the object above and below. Refer to the card overview above for requirements for the different object keys.

Use the following object as a template:

```
{
    title: "The Devil Wears Prada",
    author: ["Lauren Weisberger"],
    emojiImgs: "üòàüë©üèª‚Äçü¶≥üë†üë©üèªüëóüëõ",
    genres: ["drama", "comedy","romance"],
    year: 2003
}
```

6. Once you have completed updating the object for your show or movie, scroll to the bottom of the page and add a commit message. The commit message should be formatted like: `Added Fight Club` or `Added Casablanca`. Click the `Commit Changes` button to save your changes.

![Screenshot of creating a commit message on the Github website](readme/commit-ui.png)

7. Navigate to the `Pull Request` tab. Click on New `Pull Request`.

![Screenshot of a Pull Request on the Github website](readme/pull-request.png)

8. Review your changes and then click `Create Pull Request`. Add any additional comments, go through the checklist within the Pull Request and add an Issue number if applicable, then click on `Create Pull Request`.
9. Wait for feedback/review of your Pull Request. Your code will be reviewed and if any changes need to be made, we will let you know. Once your pull request is accepted, you will be able to see your card at [https://emojiscreen.com](https://emojiscreen.com) and you will officially have contributed to the project! üéâ

## Local Development

### This method will use your local machine to contribute to the project. This will require you to download multiple programs onto your computer. This is the method most programmers use when working on projects. 

### Required Downloads & Tools

- Terminal (Mac OS) or Command Prompt. These are installed by default on your computer. Search for the program to open it. **For Windows, [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) is recommended.**
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - This is a version control tool. For Windows, this download will include Git Bash.
- A text editor such as [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), etc.

### Local Development Instructions

1. Check the Issues to see if the [movie](https://github.com/brittanyrw/emojiscreen/labels/movie), [series of movies](https://github.com/brittanyrw/emojiscreen/labels/add%20series), [TV show](https://github.com/brittanyrw/emojiscreen/labels/tv), [or musical](https://github.com/brittanyrw/emojiscreen/labels/musical) is listed.
- If it is not listed as an Issue, continue to the next step.
- If it is listed as an Issue, take note of the issue number (the number next to the title of the Issue) so that you can add it to your pull request and write a comment in the Issue stating that you will be adding that particular movie or show. If there is already a comment in the Issue from someone saying that they will add that show or movie, choose something else to add. 
2. Fork this repository. This will create a copy of the repository and create a new repository on your account.
3. Once the repo is forked, you will be taken to the forked repo. Note: In the top left, the name of the repo should now include your username.
4. Download the project to your computer. Click on the `Clone or Download` button. Copy the HTTPS github repo link.
5. In your terminal, navigate to where you would like to save the project (such as `cd Desktop`). Run the following command in the terminal, replacing the following link with your copied link: `git clone https://github.com/your-username-will-be-here/emojipages.git`;
6. After the command has been run, in the terminal, navigate into the EmojiPages project folder: `cd emojipages`.
7. Open the `emojipages` project in your text editor of choice. Edit the `data.js` file and add a new object for your book or play in alphabetical order. **Note: If the title starts with 'The' then use the next word for alphabetical order.**. Make sure there is a comma between your object and the objects above and below. Refer to the card overview above for requirements for the different object keys.  Make sure to save your file after you have made changes. 

Use the following object as a template:

```
{
  title: "Matilda",
  author: ["Roald Dahl"],
  emojiImgs: "üë©‚Äçüè´üìöüëßü¶éüéÇ‚ú®",
  genres: ["children","fantasy"],
  year: 1988
}
```

8. If you would like to see what your addition will look like, open the `index.html` file that is in the `emojipages` folder in a web browser. The `EmojiCards` are added in a random order so it may take you a few seconds to find what you added. If you do not see any cards in the browser, this could mean that you have a typo in your `data.js` file. If that is the case, double check what you have added for missing commas and quotation marks.
9. Once you are done, go to the terminal and type `git status`. You should see `data.js` as modified. If you don't see this, go back and make sure to save your `data.js` file.
10. Run `git add -A` to add your changes.
11. Add a commit message. Run the following command and replace with your movie or show name: `git commit -m "Added 1984 by George Orwell"`.
12. If you have never used git on your computer before, you will see a message asking for you to set your email and username. If you do not see that message, continue to the next step. Run the following commands, replacing "you@example.com" with your Github email and "Your name" with your github username:

`git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`

`git config --global user.name "Your Name"`

Then re-run the commit command. Remember to replace with your book or play: `git commit -m "Added 1984 by George Orwell"`

13. Run `git push`. If you have not done this before, git push will not run until you login to your Github account. Type in your Github username and password. **NOTE: When you type your password, it will not show in the terminal. Press enter after you type your password to continue**.

14. Go to the Github website and navigate to the `Pull Request` tab. Click on New `Pull Request`.

![Screenshot of a Pull Request on the Github website](readme/pull-request.png)

15. Review your changes and then click `Create Pull Request`. Add any additional comments, go through the checklist within the Pull Request and add an Issue number if applicable, then click on `Create Pull Request`.
16. Wait for feedback/review of your Pull Request. Your code will be reviewed and if any changes need to be made, we will let you know. Once your pull request is accepted, you will be able to see your card at [https://emojipages.com](https://emojipages.com) and you will officially have contributed to the project! üéâ
